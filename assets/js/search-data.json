This logic path determines whether a patient meets criteria for higher than average risk for colorectal cancer, as defined in the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF). This path can be used to ensure that recommendations are suppressed for patients meeting increased risk criteria. Clinical Review . | Which increased risk populations should have colorectal screening/surveillance managed in the context of primary care? . | Are there populations for whom, despite being managed by a specialist, we should consider interventions for in the context of primary care (e.g. identifying patients at risk for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes)? | . | During the environmental scan, we identified guidelines for very specific populations (childhood/young adult cancer survivors, cystic fibrosis). | Should we consider excluding patients with history of abdominal or pelvic radiation for a previous cancer (considered at increased risk by ACS guideline) from the average risk screening path? Guideline identified in environmental scan: Children’s Oncology Group Survivorship Guidelines. | Cystic fibrosis is not called out by any of the major guidelines as a population at increased risk for colorectal cancer; we’re planning to treat these patients as average risk.

This page includes: . | High-level flow diagram, which visually illustrate the main logic paths translated, applicable guidelines, and order of precedence and dependencies among logic paths. | A combined view of mid-level flow diagrams, which provide a more detailed view of each logic path and how they relate to each other. | . Each logic path has a dedicated page under Logic Paths, which includes the mid-level flow diagram for the path, as well as semi-structured logic statements. These may refer to: . | Data elements: logic statements used multiple times across the specification; and | Terminology: clinical concepts that will eventually be represented by lists of codes. | Supporting logic paths: additional logic paths referenced by one or more of the main logic paths. | . Note . Several sections and pages are under active development and may be sparsely populated or likely to undergo significant modifications. Instructions for TEP Members . | For each cycle of review, we will ask you to focus on specific sections and logic paths, with special attention to the questions under the Clinical Review section in each page. | The focus of clinical validation should be on the faithful translation of guideline recommendations and the resolution of clinical ambiguities and areas of ommission in the guidelines. | The terminology section is very sparsely populated at this time, and can be ignored. | If you have questions about the specification or need clarification please do not hesitate to reach out to colorectalcds@mitre.org | .
