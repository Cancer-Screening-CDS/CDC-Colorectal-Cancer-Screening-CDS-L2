    "content": "Description . This logic path makes a determination on whether an individual is due/overdue for CRC screening, based on screening history, and U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on the age to start and to stop screening, modalities and screening intervals. The path is intended for use with either individual patient alerts/flagging or for generating asynchronous reports on a cohort of patients in order to target outreach or escalation. Clinical Review . | Are there specific recommendations from other average-risk guidelines outside of USPSTF (e.g. USMSTF, ACS, ACG) that are important to translate? . | For example, is there value in translating recommendations which help reduce the number of modalities offered (i.e. tiered approach)? | USPSTF does not make a recommendation for people older than 86 years old.

If you have suggestions on resources we should review to refine the content, that will often suffice. | The Terminology page is sparsely populated and can be safely ignored. | If you have questions about the specification or need clarification please do not hesitate to reach out to colorectal-cds-list@mitre.org. | .
