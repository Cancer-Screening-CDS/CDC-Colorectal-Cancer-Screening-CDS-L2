    "content": "Description . This logic path makes recommendations and provides considerations for next steps after a screening or follow-up colonoscopy for average risk patients. The path is intended for use with either individual patient alerts/flagging, or for generating asynchronous reports on any post-colonoscopy follow-up for average risk patients (e.g. documenting next screening due date, any follow-up with colonoscopist). Clinical Review . | When a recall interval is not provided by endoscopist, the recommendation is to follow-up with the endoscopist, which can be accompanied by summary information/reference to recommendations for follow-up colonoscopy/surveillance/poor prep. Should we consider making a direct recommendation for follow-up when the colonoscopy is normal? This may not be straightfoward for patients with a history of polyps. | Should we consider a recommendation for a repeat colonoscopy when colonoscopy is incomplete, or there is inadequate bowel preparation? Currently we assume this will be handled by the endoscopist. Guidelines do not provide recommended intervals for this scenario. | . Mid-Level Flow Diagram .

Instructions for TEP Members . | For each cycle of review, we will ask you to focus on specific sections and logic paths, with special attention to the questions under the Clinical Review section in each page. | The focus of clinical validation should be on the faithful translation of guideline recommendations and the resolution of clinical ambiguities and areas of ommission in the guidelines. | You do not have to provide feedback in writing, just be prepared to discuss the clinical review questions and any additional feedback at the next TEP meeting. | We are not looking for you to do extensive research on any particular question, or provide a definitive answer. If you have suggestions on resources we should review to refine the content, that will often suffice. | The Terminology page is sparsely populated and can be safely ignored. | If you have questions about the specification or need clarification please do not hesitate to reach out to colorectal-cds-list@mitre.org. | .
