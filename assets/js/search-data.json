Actions . | Recommend start screening at 40 or earlier for patients with a first-degree relative with a family history of CRCDescription For patients with a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or an advanced adenoma/advanced serrated lesion diagnosed at &gt;= 60 years: * Start screening at 40 years old. * Modality and interval: tests and intervals are as per the average risk screening recommendations. For patients with a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or an advanced adenoma/advanced serrated lesion diagnosed at &lt; 60 years: * Start screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis or age 40, whichever is earlier. * Modality and interval: colonoscopy every 5 years. * Considerations: If patient refuses colonoscopy, offer annual FIT. If no significant neoplasia appears by age 60 years, can offer expanding the interval between colonoscopies. For patients with 2 or more first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or an advanced adenoma/advanced serrated lesion: * Start screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis or age 40, whichever is earlier. * Modality and interval: colonoscopy every 5 years. * Considerations: If patient refuses colonoscopy, offer annual FIT. Additional considerations for all patients with family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyps: * When dysplasia is found on colonoscopy, surveillance interval should favor shortest indicated interval based on either history or polyp findings.Rationale * We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma diagnosed at age &lt;60 years or with 2 fi rst-degree relatives with CRC and/or documented advanced adenomas undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest first-degree relative was diagnosed or age 40, whichever is earlier (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). (USMSTF, 2017) * We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma at age &gt;=60 years begin screening at age 40. The options for screening and the recommended intervals are the same as those for average-risk persons (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). (USMSTF, 2017) * We suggest that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with a documented advanced serrated lesion (SSP or traditional serrated adenoma &gt;= 10 mm in size or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia) should be screened according to above recommendations for persons with a family history of adocumented advanced adenoma (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). (USMSTF, 2017) * We recommend that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with CRC or documented advanced adenomas, for whom we recommend colonoscopy, should be offered annual FIT if they decline colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). (USMSTF, 2017) * Recent evidence suggests if persons with a single first-degree relative with a family history of CRC reach the age of approximately 60 years without manifesting significant colorectal neoplasia, then they are unlikely to be at increased risk of CRC and can be offered the option of expanding the interval between examinations. (USMSTF, 2017). * [Polyp surveillance] recommendations must be judiciously applied to individuals with a personal or family history of CRC, favoring the shortest indicated interval based on either history or polyp findings.

(USMSTF, 2022) * Although the initiation age for colonoscopy remains uncertain, we also suggest initiation of colonoscopy at same time as esophagogastroduodenoscopy [8-10 years old]. In those in whom characteristic polyps are detected, both colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be repeated every 2–3 years. In those in whom there are no Peutz-Jeghers polyps at baseline, surveillance is repeated at age 18 years, or sooner should symptoms arise, and then every 3 years.

(Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) (ACG, 2015) * The risk of neoplasia in Crohn's colitis increases with both the duration and the extent of disease. Those individuals with primary sclerosing cholangitis should initiate surveillance colonoscopy at the time of their diagnosis regardless of disease distribution.

(ACG, 2019) | . | Recommend screening colonoscopy 8-10 years after disease onset, and surveillance colonoscopy every 1-5 years thereafterDescription Initial screening: 8-10 years after onset of disease. Modality and interval: colonoscopy every 1-5 years. Specific interval based on individual risk factors including: * Prior and current burden of colonic inflammation * Family history of colorectal cancer * History of colorectal dysplasia * Frequency and quality of previous surveillance examinations * Anatomic abnormalityRationale Full recommendation text: * Initial colonoscopy screening for dysplasia should be performed at 8–10 years after disease diagnosis in all people with colonic inflammatory bowel disease, and immediately on diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. (AGA, 2021) * After a negative screening colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed every 1–5 years based on risk factors for colorectal cancer, considering current and prior burden of colonic inflammation, family history of colorectal cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, history of colorectal dysplasia, and frequency and quality of prior surveillance examinations. (AGA, 2021) * We recommend that all patients with UC or CD colitis undergo a screening colonoscopy 8 years after disease onset to (1) re-evaluate extent of disease and (2) initiate surveillance for colorectal neoplasia (high quality of evidence). (ASGE, 2015) * We recommend surveillance colonoscopy be performed every 1 to 3 years beginning after 8 years of disease in patients with UC with macroscopic or histologic evidence of inflammation proximal to and including the sigmoid colon and for patients with Crohn's colitis with greater than one-third of colon involvement. (ASGE, 2015) * Optimal surveillance intervals are uncertain. Whenever possible, surveillance should be undertaken when colitis is in remission, because active colitis can render accurate identification of dysplasia difficult. (ASGE, 2015) * Screening and subsequent surveillance colonoscopy to assess for dysplasia in individuals with UC of extent greater than the rectum should start 8 years after diagnosis. (ACG, 2019) * Surveillance colonoscopies in patients with UC should be performed at 1- to 3-year intervals based on the combined risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) in UC and the findings on previous colonoscopy. Specific interval should be based on combined risk factors and findings from previous examinations. (ACG, 2019) * Surveillance colonoscopy is suggested for patients who have a minimum of 8 years of [Crohn's] disease who have 30% or more of their colon involved. The risk of neoplasia in Crohn's colitis increases with both the duration and the extent of disease. Those individuals with primary sclerosing cholangitis should initiate surveillance colonoscopy at the time of their diagnosis regardless of disease distribution. We currently do not recommend routine surveillance for small bowel Crohn's disease. (ACG, 2018) | . References . | AGA (2021): Murthy, S. K. et al (2021).

Actions . | Recommend colonoscopy surveillance starting 1 year after surgery or post-operative clearing colonoscopyDescription Initiate surveillance colonoscopy: 1 year after cancer resection or post-operative clearing colonoscopy. For patients with certain localized rectal cancers, additional local surveillance every 2-3 months for the first 2-3 after surgery/post-operative clearing colonoscopy should be considered. Routine surveillance intervals: * After the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (4 years after surgery or postoperative clearing colonoscopy). * After the 3-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 5 years (9 years after surgery or postoperative clearing colonoscopy). * Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals, until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. For patients with certain localized rectal cancers (e.g. partial, local or endoscopic excision or who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy), consider additional local surveillance with (flexible sigmoidoscopy or EUS) every 3-6 months for the first 2-3 years after surgery/perioperative colonoscopy. Intervals for neoplastic polyp(s) surveillance: If neoplastic polyps are detected in surveillance, the subsequent surveillance interval should be provided by the endoscopist, consistent with the shorter interval of: * Recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance * Recommendations for surveillance after colorectal cancer resection (routine surveillance intervals above).Rationale FULL RECOMMENDATION TEXT: * We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy), and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals, until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. These intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome. (USMSTF, 2016) * Patients with localized rectal cancer who have undergone surgery without total mesorectal excision, those who have undergone transanal local excision (transanal excision or transanal endoscopic microsurgery) or endoscopic submucosal dissection, and those with locally advanced rectal cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation and then surgery using total mesorectal excision techniques are at increased risk for local recurrence. In these situations, we suggest local surveillance with flexible sigmoidoscopy or EUS every 3-6 months for the first 2-3 years after surgery. These surveillance measures are in addition to recommended colonoscopic surveillance for metachronous neoplasia. (USMSTF, 2016) * If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with the published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals (USMSTF, 2016). * This article does not include recommendations for follow-up for individuals with hereditary CRC syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis), inflammatory bowel disease, a personal history of CRC (including malignant polyps), family history of CRC or colorectal neoplasia, or serrated polyposis syndrome. As such, our recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy do not apply to these groups except in cases where polyp findings would result in a shorter colonoscopy interval than indicated based on the status of these clinical conditions.

    "content": "This document includes a semi-structured representation of evidence-based narrative guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening. Semi-structured representation, also known as Level 2 representation of guideline content and recommendations essential for the development of computable clinical decision support (CDS) artifacts. It includes: . | High-level and mid-level flow diagrams that visually illustrate portions of the guidelines | A brief description of each portion of the CDS logic | Semi-structured logic statements that list required clinical concepts, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, events (decision points), and actions (output, e.g. recommendations). | . How to Navigate the Specification . Start with Pathway. This page includes: . | High-level flow diagram, which visually illustrate the main logic paths translated, applicable guidelines, and order of precedence and dependencies among logic paths. | A combined view of mid-level flow diagrams, which provide a more detailed view of each logic path and how they relate to each other. | . Each logic path has a dedicated page under Logic Paths, which includes the mid-level flow diagram for the path, as well as semi-structured logic statements. These may refer to: . | Data elements: logic statements used multiple times across the specification; and | Terminology: clinical concepts that will eventually be represented by lists of codes. | Supporting logic paths: additional logic paths referenced by one or more of the main logic paths. | . Note . Several sections and pages are under active development and may be sparsely populated or likely to undergo significant modifications. Instructions for TEP Members . | For each cycle of review, we will ask you to focus on specific sections and logic paths, with special attention to the questions under the Clinical Review section in each page. | The focus of clinical validation should be on the faithful translation of guideline recommendations and the resolution of clinical ambiguities and areas of ommission in the guidelines. | You do not have to provide feedback in writing, just be prepared to discuss the clinical review questions and any additional feedback at the next TEP meeting. | We are not looking for you to do extensive research on any particular question, or provide a definitive answer. If you have suggestions on resources we should review to refine the content, that will often suffice. | The Terminology page is sparsely populated and can be safely ignored. | If you have questions about the specification or need clarification please do not hesitate to reach out to colorectal-cds-list@mitre.org. | .
